# TeaMWork-39

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation for a basic [cyber security framework selector](framework_selector.ipynb) as part of the 2023 Monash-Warwick TeaMWork winter internship.
The project was hosted and supervised by [MyCISO](https://myciso.co/home)  

The selector makes use of the scikit-learn package and research undertaken as part of the internship into the use cases of 8 different cyber security frameworks to create a suitable decision tree model.
